// github.com/tve/devices contains a collection of device drivers for hardware attached to gpio pins, SPI buses and I2C buses.
// It uses google/periph for the low level access to the hardware pins. Each device driver is in its own directory and is
// stand-alone. Simple commands to test the device can be found in the cmd directory tree.
